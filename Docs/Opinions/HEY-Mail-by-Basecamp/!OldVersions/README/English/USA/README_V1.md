# Seanpm2001: Opinion on HEY! Mail client by Basecamp

## Overview

I find HEY! Mail (by Basecamp) to be a bad email client with some good features.

I discovered the client when browsing the Ubuntu software store. It was a promoted software piece. After reading its statistics, and reviews, I found the following problems with it:

- The software is closed-source (proprietary software)
- The software requires a $99/year subscription to use
- The software only lets you use an email address provided by Basecamp
- - You cannot use custom email addresses, or addresses from other services (such as protonmail, gmail, outlook, etc.)
- The software has misspellings and other errors featured prominently in key areas (such as the promotion screenshots, where `Inbox` is spelled `Imbox` (an `m` instead of an `n`)

Nevertheless, the client has a couple good features not found in other email clients. I want to change that (by making these features more available, and more free to access) the features I am talking about are:

### Screening

HEY! Mail adds a screening area, where the user can allow/block new users from emailing them if they are doing so for the first time. This can help prevent spammers and scammers from flooding your inbox

Here is how I improved on it:

```plain-text
Idea inspired by the HEY! Mail client by Basecamp, a bad email client (IMO) but a good idea

Concept:
Every new person to email you goes through a screening page.
This can also be disabled
The screening page can be sorted with many filters, such as:
- domain name
- username
- message count
- language spoken in email
- if detected as spam
- if detected as phishing
- if messages are large
The new user can have a maximum of 10 messages by default in the screening process (this can be changed in settings) if any more messages are sent, they can either be discarded, or a special filter can be applied to decline them from the screening process (this can be replaced with another action)
The screening area is exempt from the billing process of the email service provider, the provider may want to place a reasonable limit (eg: 2 gigabytes) on the screening room per email user, and increase this with larger account plans
An option to delete old messages after a certain amount of time, or after a certain amount of screening room memory is used.
```

### Attachment gallery

HEY! Mail adds a gallery page, where the user can browse email attachments (images, video, audio, documents) without individually searching through many emails, and downloading the attachments one email at a time. This helps productivity by saving time and being more user friendly.

Here is how I improved on it:

```plain-text
EMAIL 2 Gallery
Idea inspired by the HEY! Mail client by Basecamp, a bad email client (IMO) but a good idea

Concept:
EMAIL attachments can be saved to a special gallery that is easy to browse, instead of going email through email, finding attachments.
The gallery can be sorted by media type, file type, date, receiver, read, unread, and more.
The gallery can be put into offline storage
The gallery can be enabled/disabled
The gallery does not use up additional account space

Taking 2 ideas from a bad email client I found, and adding them to the EMAIL 2 standard, with many improvements (they are good ideas, but HEY! Mail by Basecamp is not a very good EMAIL client, as it is closed source, requires a $99/month subscription, and disallows you from using another email provider. I found its screening and attachment libraries good ideas that should be available to everyone, and I improved on them in my standard draft.

## Summary

I have taken 2 ideas from a bad email client I found, and added them to the EMAIL 2 standard, with many improvements (they are good ideas, but HEY! Mail by Basecamp is not a very good EMAIL client, as it is closed source, requires a $99/month subscription, and disallows you from using another email provider. I found its screening and attachment libraries good ideas that should be available to everyone, and I improved on them in my standard draft.

> **Disclaimer:** I have never used HEY! Mail by Basecamp, I am going off of existing knowledge, and other user experiences.
