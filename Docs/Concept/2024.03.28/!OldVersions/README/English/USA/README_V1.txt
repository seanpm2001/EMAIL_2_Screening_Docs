EMAIL 2 Screening
Idea inspired by the HEY! Mail client by Basecamp, a bad email client (IMO) but a good idea

Concept:
Every new person to email you goes through a screening page.
This can also be disabled
The screening page can be sorted with many filters, such as:
- domain name
- username
- message count
- language spoken in email
- if detected as spam
- if detected as phishing
- if messages are large
The new user can have a maximum of 10 messages by default in the screening process (this can be changed in settings) if any more messages are sent, they can either be discarded, or a special filter can be applied to decline them from the screening process (this can be replaced with another action)
The screening area is exempt from the billing process of the email service provider, the provider may want to place a reasonable limit (eg: 2 gigabytes) on the screening room per email user, and increase this with larger account plans
An option to delete old messages after a certain amount of time, or after a certain amount of screening room memory is used.
